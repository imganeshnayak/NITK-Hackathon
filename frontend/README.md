*Admin Dashboard (Desktop & Mobile)*

Fully Responsive Admin Dashboard: A dashboard for admins to approve/reject batches. It cleverly displays data as a table on desktops and reflows into a card list on mobile devices for optimal user experience.

Light/Dark Mode: A theme toggle allows users to switch between light and dark modes for comfortable viewing.

Persistent Theme: The user's theme choice is saved in their browser's localStorage for a consistent experience on return visits.
